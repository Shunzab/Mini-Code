# ðŸŽ¯ Domain Range Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Domain Range Number Guessing Game**, a fun Python-based command-line experience where you set the limitsâ€”and the computer tries to stump you with a random number between them.

## ðŸ“œ Description

This game lets the user:
- Choose a range (lower and upper limits)
- Attempt to guess a randomly generated number within that range
- Receive hints until they guess correctly

Each round provides feedback like "A little lower!" or "Higher, Higher!" to guide the guesser.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Save the code in a file named `guess_game.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
